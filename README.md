# ts-react-starter

A barebones webpack based starter without of the box config for typescript, react, storybook, eslint and prettier. Dev-server configured with
React Fast Refresh and HTML Webpack Plugin.

# Customizing

At some point I'll get around to automatic the customization. But for now, you should probably minimally edit:

* package.json
* webpack.*.js

Beyond this, all configs are transparently available to you.
